# Terms of Service

## Welcome to ScorchChess!
This page explains our terms of use. When you use ScorchChess, you’re agreeing to all the rules on this page. Some of them need to be expressed in specific legal language but we’ve done our best to offer you clear and simple explanations of what everything means.

By using this website (the “Site”) and services (together with the Site, the “Services”) offered by ScorchChess (together with our subsidiaries, affiliates, representatives, and directors – collectively “ScorchChess”, “we”, or “us”) you’re agreeing to these legally binding rules (the “Terms”). You’re also agreeing to our Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy, and agreeing to follow any other rules on the Site, like our Fair Play rules (included below).

We may change these terms from time to time. If we do, we’ll let you know about any significant or material changes, by notifying you on the Site. New versions of the terms will never apply retroactively – we’ll tell you the exact date they go into effect. If you continue using ScorchChess after a change, that means you accept the new terms.

## Introduction
ScorchResults is a digitisation of the process of organising a chess tournament. Users of the site are encouraged to use our services and content to contribute to the smooth running of the chess tournament and to further the pursuit of chess as a whole. We actively want to foster our community’s development, enjoyment, and study of chess. We also want to hear what you think would add to your development and enjoyment, so feel free to contact us with suggestions at any time.

## Creating an Account
You’re responsible for your account and all the activity on it.

You can browse ScorchChess and use some of our Services without registering an account. But to use all of ScorchChess’ functions, you’ll need to register. This is done by choosing a username, setting a password, and securing it with a valid email address. If you don’t submit accurate information, you might not be able to access your account.

When you do that, the information you give us has to be accurate and complete. Don’t impersonate anyone else or choose names that are offensive or that violate anyone’s rights. If you don’t follow these rules, we reserve the right to close your account without warning. ScorchChess also reserves the right to revoke access to any username, if they are considered abusive via language or should be received for use by particular verified organisations (such as "4ncl" for the 4 Nations Chess League). ScorchChess also reserves the right to close any account too for abusive behaviour, which includes but is not limited to the creation of spam, profanity within customisable sections (such as bios and descriptions), or abuse of the photo-linking feature. Not many features are at this moment available which could lead to account closure.

When these terms discuss “Users” or a “User”, we’ll be referring to both registered and unregistered users, unless it relates to features, information or data an unregistered User does not or cannot have access to.

## User Rights
Both registered and unregistered users have rights to protect their property, privacy, and identity unless they have consented or agree to making their identity public. Most information on this topic can be found in our [Privacy Policy](/privacy).

ScorchChess believes that users should have their public information, identity, and data protected as strongly as possible. We use European Union data protection law as our baseline, and in many respects go further than what the law requires. We’ve also chosen to extend these rights to all users, not just those under a European Union jurisdiction.

By agreeing to these Terms, registered Users can have access to all of ScorchChess’ features. The scope of features available is dependent on the context of the user account. If a user is playing in a tournament organised by by a Licensed user, the scope of features available is modified to suit.

Our [Privacy Policy](/privacy) states which data ScorchChess will take from a User’s device and why it does. This data will only ever be in line with our legal obligations, being necessary and proportionate. A User can query what data ScorchChess has on them by making a Subject Access Request to the ScorchChess developers.

In all circumstances, we may retain certain information as required by law or necessary for our legitimate operating purposes. All of the provisions within this agreement survive the termination of an account.

## Fair Play and Community Guidelines
Users, both registered and unregistered agree to behave with good conduct whilst using ScorchChess’ Services. This will always be determined at ScorchChess’ discretion. Users who don’t behave with good conduct may have their account banned or closed without warning, and their content removed from the site. In all circumstances we reserve the right to ban or close an account for any reason without warning, and without having to provide evidence that Fair Play and Community Guidelines have been breached.

See the following for some examples of what you shouldn’t do.

1. Spam.

2. Abuse of customisable fields, such as Description or Bio fields. Abusive behaviour includes scribing links to malicious external websites or writing content wchih seeks to offend.

3. Impersonation. Don’t pretend to be someone who you’re not. You’re welcome to use a pseudonym. Usernames will be revoked to the highest organisation existing authority in accordance with the aforementioned policy.

4. Trying to break into accounts of other users, even if it’s as simple as just guessing a password, DDoS and volumetric attacks. This activity is illegal under the Computer Misuse Act, so the relevant authorities would also be notified. You are welcome to support ScorchChess by finding and reporting security issues to us.

5. Abuse our infrastructure. Don’t take any action that imposes an unreasonable load on our infrastructure or on our third-party providers. We reserve the right to determine what is reasonable.

In the event any provision of these terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will be limited to the minimum enforcement possible, and the remaining terms held with full effect.

These terms are an agreement between you and ScorchChess.
